You\u2019ll need it if you contact support regarding a\nwarranty, and it\u2019s important to have if your phone is stolen.\n\nService providers can use the IMEI to block a stolen phone from cellular\nnetworks, and many police departments keep a record of stolen phones using\nthis number.\n\nYou may never need your IMEI number, but it\u2019s a good idea to record it, just\nin case.\n\nTo find the IMEI number:\n\n  1. Go to Settings > About phone.\n  2. See IMEI for your number.\n  3. Record and save the number where you can easily access it.\n\nYou can also find your IMEI number by dialing ***#06#** in the Phone app. On\nsome phones, the MEID HEX number is your IMEI number.\n\nIf your phone doesn't turn on, check the box it came in or the receipt for the\nIMEI number."
